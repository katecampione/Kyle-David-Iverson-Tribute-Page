    <p>Tor Leingaard is a semester away from graduating college. While his friends lock down positions in marketing and banking and administrative assistance, Tor can barely align the bullet points on his resume. He tells himself that the jobs his friends are getting aren’t right for him. That they’re meaningless at best and soul-crushing at worst. Still, he wonders if he’s being left behind.

To clear his head, Tor paints graffiti. He’s been painting the same spot for years, a deserted set of train tracks so low key he’s never seen another person there. Until one day in January when he meets Darla Velasquez aka Heat, the best graffiti writer in the Twin Cities.

When Darla invites Tor to paint, he can’t refuse, even though she has no intention of sticking to the tracks. Street art, Darla says, is meant for the streets. But as Darla pulls Tor into the dangerous world of graffiti writing, the normal life he’s been avoiding looks as though it might slip away for good.

            "He’s better than me. You can tell by his outfit. Black dress shoes, black belt. Collared shirt tucked into black slacks. There’s bleach stains on my shorts. My t-shirt’s faded almost gray and punched through with burn holes from half a dozen drunken cigarettes. My belt isn’t even black, it’s brown. My toes are stuck through holes in my shoes. He’s early, of course. Smiles and handshakes and ‘my name’s Alex, what’s yours?’ to everyone in the kitchen. He makes a joke about being bad with names but he’ll probably remember everyone’s. Unlike me, who’s actually bad with names. I called Seff ‘Seth’ until a week ago. I’ve been here a month."

       <div style="float: right; width: 80%;">     
      <p>
        Not to be confused with "The Girl on the Train", this is a story about a boy. A boy who falls madly in love with a girl and breaks her heart. A tearful "goodbye forever" at the airport, the empty seat next to her, and the empty seat next to him. This story will break your heart. But will it have a happy ending?

     <p>Kyle has spent most of his adult years traveling the world. He lived and studied on a cruise ship for 6 months stepping foot on almost every continent. He spent several months in Africa visiting his then-girlfriend, self-funded a trip to Central America thanks to credit cards, traveled across southeast asia eating sketchy street-meats, and scrubbed several hundred toilets on both the East and West coasts of Australia. In Kyle's dope ass travel blog, he skillfully illustrates the <em>real</em> experience of traveling abroad.
